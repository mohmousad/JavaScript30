### 5. Flexbox Image Gallery

**Date:** 28 Feb 2022

**Description:**

- HTML page contains a flexbox container of images, each image can be expanded and collapsed by clicking.

- Learned about CSS transitions, flexbox, flex property.

- The main effect of expanding and collapsing the image is done by flex property:

            div {
                flex: 1;
            }

            div:hover{
                flex: 5;
            }

- Learned about NodeList methods, ( In my first trial I converted panels NodeList to array to use forEach with it )
